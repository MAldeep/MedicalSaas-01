# Medical Files SaaS Project Plan 

## [Overview]
This Project serves the medical clinics.
Its main adv. is to save the medical files of the patients in a secure way.
so mainly, it is a SaaS application that allows the clinics to save the medical files of the patients in a secure way and facilitate the access to them.
### [Features]
Current Feature : 
- a customized form that accepts the medical info of the patient and save it in a database.
- a search feature that allows the clinics to search for the medical files of the patients.
- a sharing feature that allows the clinics to share the medical files of the patients with other clinics.
### [Design]
Home page : 
- a search bar that allows the clinics to search for the medical files of the patients.
- a button that allows the clinics to add a new patient.
- a button that allows the clinics to login.
Patient's file page :

- a button that allows the clinics to delete the medical info of the patient.
- a button that allows the clinic to edit the medical info of the patient.
- a button for logout.

### [Technology Stack]

- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express
- Firebase
### [Timeline]
- 1 month
### [Team]
- 2 developers
### [Conclusion]
This plan outlines a solid foundation for a medical SaaS MVP. However, critical details regarding security and specific implementation paths need refinement.

## [AI Review & Suggestions]

### 1. Technology Decisions
- **Redundant Backend**: You listed Next.js, Node.js, and Express. Next.js handles backend logic via API Routes/Server Actions. **Suggestion**: Drop the separate Express server to simplify deployment and state management, unless you have a specific microservice need.
- **Database Overlap**: You listed both MongoDB and Firebase. **Suggestion**: Clarify roles. 
    - *Option A*: Firebase for everything (Auth, Database, Storage) -> Fastest for MVP.
    - *Option B*: existing choice (MongoDB for data, Firebase for Auth/Storage) -> Good for scalability but more setup.
- **File Storage**: You need a specific solution for storing standard files (X-rays, PDFs). MongoDB is poor for large files. **Suggestion**: Add AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Vercel Blob to the stack.

### 2. Critical Missing Feature: Security & Compliance
- **HIPAA/GDPR**: Medical apps legally require strict data protection. 
- **Audit Logs**: You MUST track every view/edit/share of a patient file. **Suggestion**: Add an "Audit Log" feature.
- **Encryption**: valid encryption at rest and in transit is non-negotiable.

### 3. Feature Enhancements
- **Sharing Mechanism**: "Sharing with other clinics" is risky. **Suggestion**: Implement "Secure One-Time Links" with password protection and expiry, or a "Clinic-to-Clinic" handshake protocol.
- **Patient Identification**: Search by name is not enough (duplicates). **Suggestion**: specific Patient ID or National ID field is required.

### 4. UI/UX Recommendations
- **Dashboard**: "Home page" should transition to a specific "Dashboard" view post-login showing recent patients or upcoming appointments.
